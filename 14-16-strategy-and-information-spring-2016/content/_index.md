This is an advanced course in game theory. We begin with a rigorous overview of the main equilibrium concepts for non-­cooperative games in both static and dynamic settings with either complete or incomplete information. We define and explore properties of iterated strict dominance, rationalizability, Nash equilibrium, subgame perfection, sequential, perfect and proper equilibria, the intuitive criterion, and iterated weak dominance. We discuss applications to auctions, bargaining, and repeated games. Then we introduce solution concepts for cooperative games and study non-­cooperative implementations. Other topics include matching theory and networks.
